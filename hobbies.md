> Over the past year, I’ve remained passionate about swimming, but the lack of convenient and decent swimming pools in Cambridge has been an inconvenience. As a result, I’ve been swimming less frequently and have gained some weight. If you’re also in Cambridge and interested in swimming, running, or cycling together, feel free to contact me!

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water.
