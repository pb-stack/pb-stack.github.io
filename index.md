# About Me

<img src="https://pb-stack.github.io/Grad1.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I am **Pranav**. Nice to meet you!<br>
<br>
Currently based in Amstelveen, Netherlands. Having recently relocated, I hope to work with new clients, problems, growth sectors, and a unique environment.
<br>
Across a portfolio of 4+ years of engagements, I have designed, sold, and deployed Industry 4.0 solutions, ranging from robotic automation and AMR fleets to full-stack WMS/ERP integrations initiatives. My projects are focused on driving 3-5 X throughput gains and 30%-50% cost reductions for Fortune 500 and high-growth clients in e-commerce, pharma, automotive, and manufacturing. Merging deep systems thinking and structured problem solving with hands-on execution across hardware, software, and commercial strategy, I am uniquely positioned to convert operational challenges into opportunities for growth.
<br>
I hold a Master's Engineering degree from the University of Cambridge, where I was a recipient of the St. John’s-Darwin Research Award. During my time at Cambridge, I completed consulting placements with leading firms including Kohler Mira, Thales, Bastion Therapeutics, and Kettle Foods, delivering commercialization strategies and operational improvements. I also hold an advanced diploma in Renewable Energy and Policy and trained as an Electrical/Electronics Engineer in my bachelor's degree.
<br>
When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me mountaineering, trail running, or at the clay shooting range. I'm passionate about travel, food exploration, and classic rock music.
<br>
