# About Me

<img src="https://pb-stack.github.io/Grad1.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I am **Pranav**. Nice to meet you!<br>

Currently based in Amstelveen, Netherlands. I am a technology and supply chain professional with 4+ years of hands-on experience driving the development and delivery of complex enterprise solutions (hardware + software). I specialize in translating customer needs into effective solutions through strong problem solving, technical and commercial skills, and managing cross-functional collaboration across Industry 4.0 platforms, and enterprise system integration.

I hold a Master's Engineering degree from the University of Cambridge, where I was a recipient of the St. John’s-Darwin Research Award. During my time at Cambridge, I completed consulting placements with leading firms including Kohler Mira, Thales, Bastion Therapeutics, and Kettle Foods, delivering commercialization strategies and operational improvements.

When I'm not optimizing supply chains or designing automation solutions, you'll find me mountaineering, trail running, or at the clay shooting range. I'm passionate about travel, food exploration, and classic rock music.
