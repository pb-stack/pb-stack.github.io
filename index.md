# About Me

<img src="https://pb-stack,github.io/avatar.png" class="floatpic">

Here is **Pranav Bharadwaj**.<br>

I am a technology and supply chain professional with 4+ years of hands-on experience driving the development and delivery of complex industrial automation and software solutions. Currently based in Amstelveen, I specialize in translating complex customer needs into effective solutions through strong technical and commercial skills, and managing cross-functional collaboration across Industry 4.0 platforms, robotics, and enterprise system integration.

I hold an MPhil in Industrial Systems, Manufacture, and Management from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/), where I was a recipient of the St. John's-Darwin Research Award. During my time at Cambridge, I completed consulting placements with leading firms including Kohler Mira, Thales, Bastion Therapeutics, and Kettle Foods, delivering commercialization strategies and operational improvements.

Most recently, I served as Manager of Product and Solution Sales at [Addverb Technologies](https://www.addverb.com/), where I generated $1.5M+ in revenue through transformative automation projects and developed the firm's first Vendor Partnership Program, securing $300K+ in annual sales. I have international experience across the UK, Europe, and Asia, with expertise spanning supply chain optimization, digital transformation, and sustainable manufacturing systems.

I am always open to discussing opportunities in automation, supply chain strategy, and technology partnerships. Please feel free to reach out to me at **pranavbharadwaj2023 [at] gmail.com**

## Beyond Work

When I'm not optimizing supply chains or designing automation solutions, you'll find me mountaineering, trail running, or at the clay shooting range. I'm passionate about travel, food exploration, and classic rock music. I also founded the SRM IEEE Chapter, growing membership from 1 to 63 students and raising $3,500+ for technical workshops.
