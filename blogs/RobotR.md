### ROS 2 – From Zero to Production
#### Beginner (get comfortable fast)
- [Python 3 for Robotics](https://app.theconstruct.ai/courses/python-robotics-76/) – The Construct (free tier available)
- [ROS2 for Beginners (Nav2 + SLAM)](https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotigniteacademy_learnros/ros-courses-library/ros2-for-beginners/) – The Construct
- [ETH Zurich ROS Course (2024 edition)](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) – legendary, free videos + exercises
- [Articulated Robotics ROS2 Tutorial Series](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/ready-for-ros/) – hands-down the clearest project-based path
- Official [ROS2 Tutorials – Beginner CLI & Client Libraries](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)

#### Intermediate → Real-World
- [Hello (Real) World with ROS2](https://www.edx.org/learn/robotics/delft-university-of-technology-hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-system) – TU Delft on edX (free audit)
- [ROS2 Industrial Training](https://industrial-training-mastering-ros.moveit.ai/) – PickNik & The Construct (some free modules)
- [Foxglove Studio Mastery](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio) – essential for debugging live systems

#### Advanced / Deployment
- [Navigation2 Deep Dive](https://navigation.ros.org/) + [Nav2 Slack community]
- [Micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/) – when you need ROS2 on an ESP32 or STM32
- [ROS2 Control & Hardware Interface](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html)

### Robotics Simulators (the ones actually used in industry)
- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) – quickly becoming the gold standard for warehouse and manipulation
- [Gazebo Harmonic (ROS2 native)](https://gazebosim.org/)
- [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) – surprisingly good for rapid prototyping
- [PyBullet + bullet3 examples](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
- [MuJoCo (now free)](https://mujoco.org/)

### Warehouse & Intralogistics Automation

- TU Munich Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots (still relevant for 2D Nav2 tuning)

### Books Worth Owning (paid)
- Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control – Lynch & Park (the bible)
- Probabilistic Robotics – Thrun, Burgard, Fox
- Robotics, Vision & Control – Peter Corke (Python edition)
- Springer Handbook of Robotics (2nd ed) – reference, not bedtime reading

### Machine Learning for Robotics (practical)
- [Stanford CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (free lectures)

- [Spinning Up in Deep RL – OpenAI (2018)](https://spinningup.openai.com/)

### Notes
- Almost everything on Coursera & edX can be audited for free (just click “audit” instead of “enroll with certificate”).  
- Paid books are marked. Everything else is free or has a generous free tier.
